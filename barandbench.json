    "data": "A petition has been moved before the Kerala High Court raising concern over the difficulties faced by citizens in accessing information from regional, district, and village-level government offices in Kerala due to their exclusion from the State government's online Right to Information (RTI) portal \\[_**Pravasi Legal Cell v State of Kerala & ors**_\\].\n\nThe Pravasi Legal Cell, an NGO working for the welfare of expatriates, has argued that because of such exclusion, citizens are forced to navigate outdated and cumbersome physical processes to access information at regional, district, and village offices. \n\nIt has, therefore, urged the High Court to direct the State to integrate its regional, district, and village-level offices into the Kerala government's online RTI portal.\n\nThis is to enable all citizens, particularly non-resident Indians (NRIs), to file RTI applications and access information without needing to visit government offices physically. \n\n,\n\nA Bench of Chief Justice **Nitin Jamdar** and Justice **S Manu** admitted the plea today and opined that regional, district and village offices should also be brought within the purview of the State's RTI portal. \n\nThe Court has also asked the State to clarify how much time it may need to integrate regional, district, and village-level offices into the online RTI portal.\n\nThe Secretary of the State's General Administration Department has been directed to file an affidavit responding to this query within three weeks.\n\n\"_In accordance with the direction of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Pravasi Legal Cell v Union of India & ors (2023), the regional, district and village-level offices should also be brought within the purview of online RTI portal. I find no reason why it should not be so brought in within the purview of online RTI portal. The Learned Government Pleader would take instructions from the Secretary of General Administration Department as to within how much time the regional, district and village-level offices of the State can be brought within the existing online RTI portal,\"_ the Court said. \n\nThe matter will be heard next after three weeks. \n\n,,\n\n> No reason why regional, district and village-level offices should not be brought in within the purview of online RTI portal.\n\nKerala High Court\n\nThe matter has been filed in the form of a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) petition by the Pravasi Legal Cell. \n\nIt recounted that in March 2023, the Supreme Court in _[Pravasi Legal Cell v Union of India & ors](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/55613510/)_ directed all State governments and their departments to establish online RTI portals for facilitating the filing of applications, appeals, and the provision of information electronically.\n\nThe NGO noted that while an online RTI portal was implemented in Kerala in 2019, many local offices of State departments continue to be excluded from its purview.\n\nIt has argued that Kerala, therefore, has not fully complied with the Supreme Court's 2023 directive. \n\nThe exclusion of local offices from the RTI online portal, according to the petitioner, has posed significant challenges for citizens, particularly those who reside outside India, who rely on timely access to government information. \n\nThe plea explained that RTI applicants are forced to visit treasury offices in person to make payments for information and documents from local offices, which is time consuming and difficult for citizens, especially those living in remote areas or outside the State.\n\n\"_The lack of a fully functioning online RTI portal adversely affects not only expatriates but also residents within Kerala, particularly those who live in remote areas,\"_ the plea said.\n\nThe plea further highlighted that under Section 6(1) of the RTI Act, 2005, citizens are entitled to file RTI applications electronically. However, the State has yet to adopt digital payment options like UPI and net banking.\n\nThe petitioner also submitted that adopting digital payment systems for these transactions would bring transparency, improve efficiency and streamline the process of filing RTI applications, appeals, etc. while also providing access to electronic information easily.\n\n\"_With the current system, the RTI process continues to be plagued by procedural hurdles, bureaucratic inefficiency, and significant delays, thereby denying citizens their fundamental right to access information as guaranteed under the RTI Act,\"_ the plea added. \n\nThe petition has been filed through advocates Manas P Hameed, E Adithyan, Paul P Abraham, Mariyamma AK and Ipsita Ojal."

K Surendran\\].**_\n\nSurendran is accused of threatening and bribing Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) candidate K Sundara during the 2021 Kerala Legislative Assembly Elections from the Manjeswaram constituency. \n\nJustice **K Babu** today issued notice to Surendran on the State government's revision petition against the order of the Kasargode Sessions Court discharging the politician.\n\nThe prosecution case against Surendran is that when he was standing for election from Manjeswaram as the BJP candidate, he forced K Sundara to drop out of the election. \n\nSurendran and the other accused allegedly threatened Sundara and later bribed him with ₹2.5 lakh and a mobile phone worth ₹8,300 in March 2021\\. \n\nSundara later withdrew his candidacy. Voting for the election occurred in April 2021 and Surendran lost by a small margin to Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) candidate AKM Ashraf. \n\nA first information report (FIR) was later registered against Surendran and others based on a private complaint filed before a Magistrate Court by the Left Democratic Front (LDF) candidate who stood for election from the same constituency. \n\nSurendran was alleged to have committed offences punishable under Sections 171(E) (bribery), 171(B) (election bribery), 342 (wrongful confinement), 506(i) (criminal intimidation) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). \n\nHe was also charged under provisions of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 as Sundara is from a Scheduled caste community. \n\nSurendran subsequently filed an application to be discharged from the case before the Kasargode Sessions Court. \n\nHe claimed that the allegations levelled against him were false and politically motivated. He also contended that the cognizance of the election offences was taken only after the expiry of the period of limitation. \n\n,\n\nThe Sessions Court allowed Surendran's application for discharge opining that the ingredients to attract the offences of criminal intimidation and wrongful confinement were not present and neither were the ingredients to attract the offences under the SC/ST Act. \n\nThe Sessions Court also said that even though there is sufficient material to frame charges for the election bribery, the court has no authority to frame charge after the period of limitation.\n\nThis led to the present criminal revision petition by the State challenging the Sessions Court's order. \n\nAs per the State's plea, the Sessions Court relied on the statement of a witness given before the registration of the FIR. \n\nThis was improper in view of various precedents of the Supreme Court which holds that the defence case cannot be put forth at the stage of framing charge, it has been submitted.\n\n\"_The court below has gone beyond the jurisdiction available under section 227 of CRPC and proceeded to hold a mini trial purely based on materials which are not put to proof...Consideration of existence of sufficient ground does not mean that the court can evaluate the materials produced by the police as if it is conducting the trial of the accused,_\" the petition states.\n\nThe State has also argued that the prosecution material was more than sufficient to put the accused to trial.\n\nFurther, it is the State's case that the bar for taking congisance of the election offences after the period of limitation is not applicable in this case as there are other cognisable offences as well.

Peerzada Shah Fahad**_\\]_._\n\nThe Division Bench of Justices **Bela M Trivedi** and **Satish Chandra Sharma** said that it is not setting aside the bail order since the journalist has remained out on bail for about a year and since the trial against him has already started.\n\n,\n\nHowever, the top court disagreed with the High Court's interpretation of when bail can be granted in UAPA cases. \n\nIt proceeded to declare the Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court's judgment granting bail to Fahad as _per incuriam -_ that is, bad in law for having been passed without noticing binding legal precedents.\n\n_\"Suffice it to say that having regard to the aforestated judgments of the Constitution Benches, it is directed that the impugned judgment and order being per incuriam shall not be cited as a precedent in any other case. It is also needless to say that any breach of conditions of bail or non-cooperation of the respondent in proceeding with the trial shall entail cancellation of his bail,\"_ the Court said in its October 14 order. \n\n, \n\nFahad, an editor of 'The Kashmir Walla', was booked under the UAPA for allegedly publishing articles that incite violence and promote a separatist ideology. \n\nIn November 2023, the Jammu and Kashmir High Court granted him bail while also quashing some of the several charges filed against him under the UAPA and the Indian Penal Code (IPC). \n\nAggrieved, the Union Territory challenged this order to the extent that it granted bail and quashed some charges.\n\n,\n\nNotably, in its bail order, the High Court had relied on a 1919 decision of the United States Supreme Court in _**Schenck v. United States**_ to hold that a UAPA accused can be granted bail if he does not present any _\"clear and present danger\"_ to society.\n\nRepresenting the Jammu and Kashmir administration, Solicitor General **Tushar Mehta** told the Supreme Court that the doctrine of _“clear and present danger”_ has already been rejected in several earlier rulings such as in the cases of _Babulal Parate v. State of Maharashtra (1961)_, _State of Madras v. VG Row (1952)_, and _Arup Bhuyan v.

Ltd. and others v. Janus Aviation Pvt. Ltd.**_\\].\n\nThe insurance companies had argued that ground handler, Janus Aviation Pvt. Ltd. was liable to reimburse the insurers for compensation awarded to Indigo over a 2018 incident at Nagpur's Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar International Airport.\n\nThe insurers (plaintiffs) blamed Janus (defendant) for failing to secure a flyaway passenger ladder which ended up damaging an Indigo airplane's wing leading to the insurance claim. \n\nThe Court, however, ruled that the insurers failed to prove that they had a direct contractual relationship with Janus, leading to the dismissal of their $31 million claim against Janus.\n\n, \n\nThe Court explained that the plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate any privity of contract with the defendant.\n\nThe Court, therefore, upheld a commercial court's dismissal of the insurers' suit, ruling that it did not qualify as a commercial dispute under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015.\n\n“_There is no privity of contract between the defendant and Interglobe Aviation Limited (Indigo) ... In the wake of the above, since the present proceedings that is in the form of the suit do not arise of the agreement of insurance or reinsurance, as contemplated under 2(1)(c)(x) of the Act of 2015, we find no fault with the impugned order,\"_ the High Court's order stated.\n\nThe dispute originated from an incident from May 26, 2018, when an ATR-72-600 aircraft of Indigo Airlines was parked at the airport, preparing for a flight to Hyderabad. During this time, a passenger ladder owned by Janus Aviation was reportedly blown by the wind, striking the aircraft and causing substantial damage.\n\nThe insurers claimed that they were entitled to recover damages for the losses incurred after compensating Indigo for the aircraft damage due to Janus's alleged negligence.\n\nThey sought damages totalling USD 31,777,696.98, (equivalent to ₹24,69,07,055) asserting that the incident was a direct result of the ground handling service provider's failure to secure its equipment properly.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued that their suit was rooted in a subrogated recovery of damages following an insurance agreement with Interglobe Aviation (Indigo). They contended that the case qualified as a commercial dispute because it arose from their role as insurers of the damaged aircraft. \n\n,\n\nHowever, the defendant raised several objections, asserting that the plaintiffs could not classify the suit as a commercial dispute.\n\nJanus argued that the plaintiffs relied on an indirect relationship with Indigo, stating that any claim for damages should originate from a direct contract between Indigo and Janus, which did not exist.\n\nThe defendant maintained that the underlying cause of action was based on tort rather than contract, further disqualifying the case from being heard as a commercial suit.\n\n,\n\nUltimately, the judges agreed with the defendant's objections, concluding that without a direct contractual link between Janus and the insurers, the suit could not be classified as a commercial dispute. \n\nThe High Court proceeded to uphold the lower court's reasoning for dismissing the suit under Order VII, Rule 10 of the Civil Procedure Code, which deals with the return of a plaint when a court finds it lacks jurisdiction to hear a case.\n\nAdvocate Ritesh Dawda appeared for the insurance companies.\n\nAdvocates Deoul Pathak, and Ishaan Chhayya appeared for Janus aviation.\n\n,\n\n**\\[Read order\\]**\n\n,"

These include a direction to the investigating agencies to maintain impeccable records of all seized material, to list them out with detailed description in a serialised manner in the records register and to provide the estimated monetary value of all such items.\n\nIt said that in case cash is seized by the probe agencies, photographs or videograph of currency notes must be taken and serial numbers of the seized currency notes shall be written in “mazhar” or record book.\n\n_“Immediate steps are to be taken to deposit the currency notes to Reserve Bank of India and value of the currency notes thereof shall be ordered to be returned to the successful party at the end of the trial,”_ the Court said.\n\nThe Court further directed that trial courts must compare each seized item with the description given in such register. It also said that unless specific grounds are established by the investigating agencies, trial courts must not allow such properties to be retained by the probe authorities.\n\n_“Unless a specific grounds/reasons are made out by the Investigating Agency, seized property shall not be allowed to be retained by the Investigating Agency.

Therefore, while the guidelines are encouraged, they are not enforced as mandatory across the profession.\n\n,\n\nThe BCI has emphasised that senior advocates and law firms should not only focus on financial support, but also provide mentorship to junior advocates. This includes offering opportunities for courtroom observation, guidance on legal research, drafting and case strategy.\n\nThe guidelines encourage senior advocates and firms to formalise the engagement of junior advocates with letters specifying stipend amounts, duration and mentorship opportunities. Accurate records of stipend payments and engagement terms are to be maintained and submitted to the respective state bar councils in an annual report.\n\n,\n\nJunior advocates who do not receive the recommended stipend or face engagement-related grievances can file complaints with their respective state bar council.

In this context, it is necessary to state that acquittal of guilty persons in serious crimes on technical or flimsy grounds would erode the very foundation of the criminal justice delivery system, which strives to balance individual rights with the preservation of social order,_\" the judgment stated. \n\n,\n\nToday, the Bench heard the accused on sentence. One of the accused had passed away during the trial. \n\nThe Court stated that since the incident occurred as a result of a quarrel between Shibin and the accused, extremely harsh punishment was not appropriate. \n\nTherefore, it decided to sentence the seven individuals to life imprisonment which is the lightest penalty for murder under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code. \n\nWhile the accused were slapped with sentences for other offences as well, the Court deemed it appropriate that their sentences run concurrently. The accused were also ordered to pay ₹1.10 lakh each as fine.\n\nThe Court also directed that the fines be disbursed to Shibin's legal representatives, including ₹5 lakh to his father who was an appellant before the High Court.\n\n, \n\nCK Shibin, an active member of the DYFI, was murdered on the night of January 22, 2015, in Vellur near Thooneri. The prosecution case was that after an altercation with Shibin, Ismail injured him in his right chest with an axe while his brother Muneer plunged a sword through his back. Shibin succumbed to his injuries.\n\nThe brutal killing shocked the local community, leading to widespread protests and demands for justice.\n\nThe accused were charged with offences punishable under Sections 143 (unlawful assembly), 148 (rioting, armed with a deadly weapon), 326 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means, 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means), 307 (attempt to murder) and 302 read with Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code.\n\nThe trial was initially conducted at the Kozhikode Special Additional Sessions Court (Marad cases), which acquitted all 17 accused in 2016\\. The acquittal was based on the court’s finding that the prosecution had failed to conclusively prove the involvement of the accused in the murder. \n\n,\n\nDissatisfied with the verdict, the State government filed appeal before the Kerala High Court. Shibin's father and individuals who sustained injuries during the quarrel between Shibin and the accused also moved appeals before the High Court \n\nBefore the High Court, the prosecution alleged that the accused were part of an armed gang associated with the IUML who attacked Shibin as well as several other persons in the vicinity including three more DYFI activists. The prosecution primarily relied on witness testimony to establish its case. \n\nUpon reviewing the evidence and hearing the appeal, the High Court found the prosecution case to be credible and convincing. It also opined that the trial court's reasons for disbelieving the witness testimonies were not cogent.\n\nTherefore, it overturned the acquittal of the accused and sentenced them to life imprisonment. \n\nSpecial Public Prosecutor SU Nazer appeared for the State.\n\nAdvocate Arun Bose appeared for Shibin's father.\n\nThe accused were represented by Senior Advocates B Raman Pillai, P Vijaya Bhanu and S Sreekumar and advocates S Rajiv, and CK Sreedharan.\n\n**\\[Read Judgment\\]**\n\n,,"

Arbitrator to clearly doubt their intentions,\"_ the Court said.\n\n,\n\nThe Court went on to say that arbitrators are adjudicating disputes in place of civil courts, and that making baseless and untenable allegations against them cannot be permitted.\n\n_“While the integrity of the arbitration ecosystem needs to be maintained, the same cannot also be made fragile by giving room to unsubstantiated or speculative allegations against arbitrators. Any such allegations would constitute interference in the arbitral process,”_ the court observed.\n\n,\n\nThe Court placed reliance on Sections 17(2) and 27(5) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.\n\nSection 27(5) mandates that any person guilty of contempt of the arbitral tribunal shall be penalised by the courts. Section 17(2) states any order issued by the arbitral tribunal shall be deemed to be an order of the court.\n\n_“A perusal of the two provisions i.e., Section 17(2) and Section 27(5) of the Act, would also show that Section 27(5) stipulates specifically that if any person is guilty of contempt of the Arbitral Tribunal, during the conduct of arbitral proceedings, the punishments would be as though the said offences had taken place in suits before the Civil Court,”_ the Court observed.\n\n,\n\nWhile ultimately accepting the first respondent's apology, the Court directed him to pay ₹10 lakh to any charitable organisation decided by the arbitrator. Further, a sum of ₹3 lakh was directed to be paid to the petitioners for costs incurred.\n\n,\n\nAdvocates Ajay Bhargava, Siddhant Kumar, Wamika Trehan, Radhika Khanna and Varun Chopra appeared for Dalmia Group. \n\nSenior Advocate **Sandeep Sethi** and Advocates Krish Kalra, Kashish Bansal and Riya Kumar represented the respondents.\n\n**\\[Read order\\]**\n\n,,"

    "headline": "Allahabad High Court reinstates judge who was terminated for marrying a second time",
    "data": "The Allahabad High Court recently set aside the termination of a judicial officer who was accused of marrying the second time during the subsistence of his first marriage.\n\nThe Division Bench of Justice **Rajan Roy** and Justice **Om Prakash Shukla** also ordered reinstatement of the officer with continuity in service. \n\nHowever, the Bench left it open to the High Court, on its administrative side, to initiate fresh disciplinary proceedings after framing proper charges against the officer.\n\n“_As regards arrears of salary, etc. a decision in this regard shall be taken as per Rules only after conclusion of fresh proceedings, if any, initiated against the petitioner by the opposite parties. If such proceedings are not initiation within six month, then a decision shall be taken in this regard in terms of 54-A of the Financial Handbook Volume II Part II to IV or such other Rule as may be applicable_,” the Court ordered.\n\n, \n\nThe officer was appointed as an Additional Civil Judge (Junior Division) in 2015\\. As per the record, he had married a woman in December 2013 and they have a girl child.\n\nHowever, in 2017, a complaint was made that he had married another woman, a Muslim, in October 2013\\. The complaint was made at a time when that woman was reported to be missing.\n\nIn 2018, a discreet inquiry was ordered into the allegations and it was found that the judge had married that woman at _Arya Samaj_ Mandir after her conversion. Accordingly, action was recommended action against him.\n\nThis led to a Vigilance Inquiry and disciplinary proceedings against the judge. In response, the judge had submitted that actually no marriage had taken place between him and that woman.\n\nIt was only a sham marriage to help the woman, his friend of 13 years, to placate and satisfy her mother who was pressing for her marriage, the judge claimed. It was also argued that the same had happened before he joined the service and thus there was no violation of the service rules.\n\nHowever, the Inquiry Officer concluded that the charges had been found proven. On that basis, the Full Court in 2020 recommended the judge’s termination. Accordingly, the State in 2021 issued the order for removal.\n\nHaving analyzed the record, the Court opined that the charge levelled against the officer was quite vague. It noted that the charge did not even mention when the second marriage had taken place. \n\n“_Thereafter, the charge goes on to say that the petitioner had failed to maintain uprightness and that the said conduct was in contravention of the norms of conduct prescribed for a Judicial Officer, wholly oblivious of the fact that on the relevant dates when the alleged marriages were solemnized in the year 2013 the petitioner had not even been selected for appointed as Judicial Officer, what to say of having been appointed, therefore, the framing of the said charge based on conduct, etc. expected of a Judicial Officer makes the non-application of mind at the time of framing of charge apparent_,” the Court said.\n\nIt added that the service conduct rules invoked against the officer apply only to a government servant. The incidents which led to the charge took place prior to him having joined the service, the Court observed.\n\n_“There is no charge levelled against the petitioner regarding his conduct as a Government servant. The allegations in the chargesheet pertain to a period prior to his joining service as a Judicial Officer, when he was not a Government servant.”_\n\nThe Court opined that these relevant aspects had not been taken into consideration while framing the charge against the officer nor were they taken into consideration during the inquiry.\n\nFurther, it noted there was no allegation that the officer had anything to do with the disappearance or kidnapping of that woman. In conclusion, the Court said the judicial officer’s version required better consideration.\n\nParticularly, the Court pointed to the Purohit’s statement that the woman in question had approached him two or three times for getting marriage certificate and she came with the judicial officer only after that. \n\n_“Why did xxx meet the Purohit alone and asked for a marriage certificate without the marriage having been solemnized? Why did she go to the Purohit to get the marriage certificate cancelled, they very next day of marriage? These questions have not been dealt in the inquiry report nor by the Disciplinary Authority. Now, all this when viewed in the light of the stand of the petitioner required a deeper scrutiny than done by the Inquiry Officer who, in fact, has not considered these aspects nor the Rule position as already discussed”._\n\nIt was also noted that the inquiry officer had ignored the fact that the woman in question, while applying for various competitive examinations, had never mentioned herself to be his wife.\n\nHowever, the Court clarified that it was not giving any conclusive opinion with regard to the alleged marriage. The very charge was factually and legally erroneous and unsustainable, it reasoned.\n\n“_The impugned orders are accordingly quashed_,” ordered the Court while giving relief to the judge.\n\nSenior Advocate Gajendra Pratap and advocate Mool Chandra represented the judicial officer.\n\nAdvocate Gaurav Mehrotra represented the High Court.\n\n,"

The woman alleged that the man had subjected her to cruelty through alcohol consumption and abusive language, prompting her to file a police complaint, as well as an application for maintenance under the DV Act.\n\nIn response, the man argued that he was already married and had three children from that wedlock. He denied that any marriage occurred between him and the woman in question. He also refuted the claim that a child was born from their relationship.\n\nWhile dismissing the man's plea against the award of maintenance, the Court observed that the DV Act was enacted with the purpose of safeguarding a woman's right to reside in her matrimonial home.\n\n_“This Act has special features with special provisions under law which provides protection to a woman to live in a violence-free home.\"_\n\n,\n\nThe Court also rejected the man's argument that since he was already married, the woman could not claim the benefits of the DV Act for a live-in relationship.\n\n_\"Material placed on record and submissions made by learned counsel for the applicant, that the applicant is already a married person and therefore, respondent No.1 cannot be granted the benefit of the D.V. Act as she cannot fall within the ambit of a live-in relationship, deserves to be rejected.

The NCLT admitted Go First’s application on May 10 and appointed a Resolution Professional (RP) to manage the company's affairs.\n\nIn response, Go First’s aircraft lessors filed an appeal with the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), arguing that their assets had been unfairly taken as they had terminated the leases prior to the moratorium. \n\nOn May 22, 2023, the NCLAT upheld the NCLT’s decision and directed the lessors to submit an appropriate application to the NCLT for clarification regarding the applicability of the moratorium on the aircraft.\n\nThe lessors filed a plea in the Delhi High Court against the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), requesting the court to direct the authority to deregister their aircraft. They contended that the DGCA should comply with lessors' requests for deregistration.\n\nInitially, the DGCA had stated it could not deregister the aircraft due to an existing moratorium. \n\nHowever, on October 4, 2023, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs issued a notification clarifying that the provisions of subsection (1) of Section 14 of IBC would not apply to transactions or agreements concerning aircraft, engines, airframes and helicopters.\n\nSubsequently, DGCA filed an affidavit before the Delhi High Court clarifying that the notification exempting aviation leases from moratorium under the IBC should apply to pending cases as well.\n\nHowever, DGCA said that since Go First's case pending in the Delhi High Court, it will await court's directions. Simply put, DGCA's response said that the though notification exempting aviation leases from moratorium should ideally apply to Go First, the authority will wait for directions from the High Court as it was sub-judice.\n\nThe Delhi High Court ordered DGCA on April 26 this year to deregister its fleet. Consequently, the DGCA deregistered all 54 of the airline's aircraft in early May. \n\nThe Court ruled that maintenance of the aircraft would be handled by the lessors and their authorized representatives until the aircraft were deregistered and exported, in line with Rule 32A of the Aircraft Rules.\n\nWithout any aircraft left and after running out of options to revive the airline, its Committee of Creditors (CoC) decided to liquidate the company and filed an application to this effect in September 2024\\. \n\n,"

The policy was to cover losses up to ₹22 lakh. \n\nIn 2013, the shop was heavily damaged amid riots and violence in Jammu and Kashmir's Kishtwar. As part of relief efforts, the Government of Jammu and Kashmir granted ₹3.5 lakh to the shop owner. \n\nThe total damage suffered to the shop was estimated to be ₹29.24 lakh. The shop's owner filed a claim with Oriental Insurance to get compensation for these losses. \n\nAfter the insurance company's survey, the total claim payable was assessed to be around ₹19.11 lakh. However, the insurance company was only willing to pay ₹15.61 lakh since the government had already given the shop owner ₹3.5 lakhs as _ex gratia_ relief. \n\nAggrieved, the insurance claimant moved the Jammu and Kashmir Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in Jammu, which granted him relief and ordered Oriental Insurance to pay ₹19.11 lakh along with litigation expenses of ₹10,000\\. \n\nThis ruling was challenged by the insurance company before the High Court. \n\nThe High Court rejected the insurance company's appeal. The Court noted that the actual damage to the wine shop exceeded even the insured amount of ₹22 lakh. Viewed from this standpoint as well, the Court opined that Oriental Insurance could not deny its obligation to pay ₹19.11 lakh without any further reduction merely because the government has paid ₹3.5 lakh as ex gratia relief. \n\n\"_It does not lie in the mouth of Insurance Company to deny the claim to the insured upto the sum insured once it has taken the premium,\"_ the Court said.\n\nAccordingly, the High Court dismissed the appeal filed by Oriental Insurance and upheld the award passed by the Jammu and Kashmir State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission at Jammu.\n\nAdvocate **DS Chouhan** appeared for Oriental Insurance.\n\nAdvocate **Rajesh Kumar** appeared for the proprietor of the insured wine shop.\n\n,\n\n**\\[Read Order\\]**\n\n,,"

It was submitted that when there is an element of public interest, there is a right to publish about it.\n\n,\n\n> It was also submitted that The Morning Context deliberately used certain damaging keywords such as ‘kidnapping’ to defame OFB.\n\nSenior Advocate Bansuri Swaraj\n\n,\n\nSenior Advocate **Bansuri Swaraj** appeared for OFB today and maintained that the reporting of the incident in The Morning Context was malicious. Since the insinuations made in the article travelled beyond the contents of the FIR, the defence of “fair comment” cannot be taken, she said. \n\nIt was also submitted that The Morning Context deliberately used certain damaging keywords such as ‘kidnapping’ to defame OFB.\n\nOFB has contended that the article was deliberately published at a time when the company was on the verge of launching its Initial Public Offer (IPO).\n\nSenior Advocate Swaraj further pointed out that the allegations in the defamatory have spread like wildfire. The cascading effect of this was such that other publications are reaching out for OFB’s comments and employees are encashing stock options (ESOPs), the plea said. These allegations have shaken the confidence of the investors, OFB argued. \n\nOFB has sought an injunction against The Morning Context to restrain them from disseminating the article any further. The company has urged the Court to declare the article as defamatory and to order a takedown of the same. OFB has also sought an unconditional apology from The Morning Context apart from ₹2.02 crores as damages.\n\n,\n\nThe plaint by OFB was filed through advocates Sanyam Khetrapal and Prakriti Anand.\n\n,"

    "data": "The Competition Commission of India (CCI) recently dismissed a plea alleging abuse of dominant position against IREL (India) Limited (formerly Indian Rare Earths Limited) _**\\[Kalpit Sultania v. IREL (India) Limited\\].**_\n\nThe four-member quorum of CCI, led by its Chairperson Ravneet Kaur, found that though IREL was in a dominant position in the business of mining and supply of Beach Sand Sillimanite in India, it did not abuse the same.\n\nThe order puts an end to CCI’s three year investigation into allegations against the Central government-owned IREL for violating the Competition Act, 2002\\. \n\nIREL, which is under the administrative control of the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), is engaged in production and sale of minerals such as Ilmenite, Rutile, Zircon, Monazite, Sillimanite and Garnet as well as various value-added products through four operational units located in Odisha, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. \n\nThe information filed before the CCI by one Kalpit Sultania pertained to a mineral called Beach Sand Sillimanite. It was contended that since 2016, Sillimanite was included in the category of atomic minerals by the Central government and hence private players were prohibited from mining it. As a consequence of this, IREL became the only corporation engaged in the production of Beach Sand Sillimanite in India.\n\nSultania contended that IREL abused its dominant position by:\n\n1. Indulging in prohibitive increase in the prices of Sillimanite from ₹ 9,000 per metric ton in 2016-17 to ₹14,000 per metric ton in 2020-2021;\n2. Following discriminatory pricing against the interests of the Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in the domestic market, while favouring multi-nationals and/or foreign parties; and\n3. Fixing the supply of Beach Sand Sillimanite as per its whims and fancies and forcing its customer to accept arbitrary quantity.\n,\n\n**DG investigation**\n\n,\n\nBased on the information filed and the responses received, the CCI came to a _prima facie_ view that IREL enjoys economic power and commercial advantage which allows it to operate independently of market forces. Thus, in January 2022, it directed the Director General (DG) to cause an investigation into the matter and submit a report as per the law.\n\nThe DG found that only IREL and Kerala Minerals and Metals Limited (KMML) remained in the business of mining and production of Beach Sand Sillimanite in India after the Central government notification. The DG noted that the market share of IREL is high for the period of the alleged abuse and it also enjoys considerable financial power, resources and infrastructure in the relevant market, especially from 2019-20 onwards.\n\nIn addition, IREL has a commercial advantage and significant control over supply when compared to its competitors. Furthermore, the consumers of this metal are dependent on the company owing to its hold on the supply as a result of which it acquired a dominant position. \n\nThe DG analysed the company’s behaviour from 2016 onwards and found that it had indulged in anti-competitive practices such as discriminatory pricing and discriminatory supply of Sillimanite against domestic customers vis-à-vis foreign customers in contravention of the Competition Act, 2002\\. \n\n**Why IREL ended up winning**\n\n,\n\nIn its arguments, IREL had contended that it was not an ‘enterprise’ under Section 2 (h) of the Competition Act, 2002, owing to it being affiliated with the DAE.\n\nHowever, the CCI found that IREL is Public Sector Undertaking designated as Miniratna Category-I. According to the order, \n\n_“The Commission observes that IREL, the erstwhile Indian Rare Earths Limited is a Public Sector Undertaking and an unlisted Public Company, was incorporated on August 18, 1950\\. It became a full-fledged Government of India Undertaking under the administrative control of Department of Atomic Energy in year 1963\\. It has its own Board of Directors for managing its overall affairs. Accordingly, the Commission is of the considered view that IREL is not a department of the Government.”_\n\nRendering its conclusion on whether IREL holds a dominant position in the market, the CCI observed, \n\n_“The Commission notes from the DG report that IREL has sizeable assets and turnover vis-à-vis its competitors. Further, from its own submission, it is clear that the consumers of IREL have absorbed high price of Sillimanite, which indicates not only dependence of consumers on it but lack of countervailing buying power.”_\n\nIt thus accepted DG’s conclusion that IREL was indeed a dominant player in the market. \n\n,\n\nTo evaluate whether IREL abused this dominant position, the CCI looked at its behaviour from the perspective of Section 4(2)(a)(ii) of the Act, which states that there would be an abuse of dominant position by an enterprise if it directly or indirectly imposes unfair or discriminatory price in purchase or sale of goods or services. \n\nThe CCI noted that the price charged by KMML was much higher than IREL despite KMML being a much small player. The order said, \n\n_“The Commission also notes that allegation have been levelled in respect of higher quantities being offloaded to a particular company and its associates and also that the price charged is substantially lower vis-à-vis what is being charged from other customers. There seems to be no economic incentives for the OP, being in a dominant position, to indulge in such activities where it sold higher quantities at lower prices.”_\n\nThe CCI noted that none of the customers who purchase Sillimanite from IREL have complained or raised grievances with respect to charging of excessive prices by IREL, and the DG has shown no evidence of any such complaints by customers. \n\n_\"On the contrary, IREL’s vigilance department received a complaint that it was charging lower prices, causing losses to IREL,\"_ the order said.\n\nThus, it found that IREL had not abused its dominant position in the market. \n\nCCI rejected the allegations of discriminatory prices and discriminatory conditions imposed by IREL. It found that IREL had devised different methodology for sale of Sillimanite across different categories of customers based on availability of quantity, past relationship and duration of contract etc. Thus, the quantities were supplied to the parties in a categorised manner wherein, the company enters into long-term contracts and annual contracts based on its commercial wisdom.\n\n,\n\nSultania was represented by Advocates Ankur Sood, Roshan Santhalia and Puja Jhankar.\n\nIREL was represented by Senior Advocate **Tarun Gulati** along with Advocates Abhay Joshi, Ayushi Sharma, Kumar Sambhav and Bhaavi Agarwal.\n\n**\\[Read order\\]**\n\n,,"

He gained recognition for his efforts in providing life-saving medications during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHe maintained close relationships with several major Bollywood stars, including Salman Khan, Shah Rukh Khan and Sanjay Dutt.\n\n,"

State of Kerala & Ors.**_\\].\n\nJustice **CS Dias** dismissed the plea that was filed in the form of an application in a previously disposed of case, wherein the High Court had ordered the trial judge to conduct an enquiry into the issue. \n\nJustice Dias opined that the application raised an issue that was substantive enough and which arose from a separate cause of action, warranting the filing of a fresh petition. \n\nTherefore, while dismissing the application, the Court clarified that it does not preclude the survivor from filing a fresh petition for a probe. \n\n\"_On an overall consideration of the facts of the case and the exposition of the law in precedents cited above, I am of the definite view that the reliefs sought in the present application are substantive in nature and arise from a fresh and independent cause of action, and are not ancillary in nature.

However, the airline responded to the notice only after the plea was filed. He said,\n\n_“The reply does not dispute the lease or the amount outstanding. It only speaks of a purported settlement.”_ \n\n,\n\nSpiceJet’s lawyer, however, pointed out that while the lessor claims to have not received a response to the Section 8 notice, they have quoted from the response in the plea before the NCLT. He urged the NCLT not to issue a notice to the plea on these grounds. \n\nAfter hearing the submissions, the NCLT asked the lessor to file a copy of the response to the Section 8 notice as an additional document. When Kapadia insisted that the bench issue notice to SpiceJet, the Tribunal said, \n\n_“You file the response and we will see.”_ \n\nThus, the Tribunal refused to issue notice to the airline. Kapadia requested the coram to post the case for hearing in the next two days so that he could file the response. The case was, however, adjourned to November 11\\. \n\nSpiceJet has been mired with a series of insolvency pleas, mainly by its lessors, since early 2023\\. In September 2024, the NCLT issued notice to SpiceJet in an insolvency plea filed by Techjockey Infotech, an operational creditor. This company claimed a default of nearly ₹1.2 crore owed by SpiceJet against software services availed by them.\n\nIn late 2023 and early 2024, the NCLT dismissed two insolvency pleas against SpiceJet by lessors Wilmington Trust SP Services and Wills Lease Finance.

However, despite obtaining passing marks, the university lowered his score and declared him 'failed.'\n\nNotably, when Rana enrolled in the academic session of 2016-17, the grading criteria were based on a 60:40 ratio, that is 60 per cent of marks were allocated for the theory paper and 40 per cent of marks were scored based on an internal assessment. 45 per cent was required to pass. \n\nHowever, in 2022, the regulations were amended retroactively from December 2018, changing the mark allocation ratio from 60:40 to 80:20\\. \n\nWhen Rana took the examination in May 2023, he earned 54 marks out of 80, thereby passing under the regulations that were in force in 2016\\. \n\nHowever, the university applied the amended regulations and scaled down his score from 54 out of 80 to 41 out of 60, resulting in him being declared 'failed.'\n\nThe Court questioned the university's decision and inquired whether there were any instructions or legal provisions that justified the scaling down of the student's marks.\n\n_“The only answer which they have given to this Court is that it is a past practice and by virtue of the same, they have been converting the criteria/formula for assessment of marks of their own at the clerical and superintendent level but there is no instructions or any provision of law of University despite the fact that the petitioner was subjected to an examination paper in which the maximum marks as reproduced above were 80,\"_ the Court noted.\n\nThe Court deemed the university's reasoning—that the student, having enrolled in the academic session of 2016 but appearing for the exam in May 2023, should be assessed under the 80:20 ratio instead of the 60:40 ratio—as _perverse_ and _completely unsustainable._\n\n_“There is nothing on record nor it has been shown to the Court and rather it has been so stated by the officers who are present in the Court and learned counsel for the respondent-University that there is no formula designed and there is no law or source of power by which such a power was exercised by the examination department of the University,”_ the Court remarked.\n\nThe Court further noted that the decision was arbitrary and based on whims, which adversely impacted the student's career.\n\n_“If errors or illegal actions have been committed by the respondent-University, the same cannot be applied to the present case merely because the same is a past practice ... However, the same cannot be done only on the basis of precedents which ultimately deprives the rights of their own students,”_ the Court added.\n\nThe Court thus set aside the challenged result and directed the university to process the grant of the student's degree.\n\nAdvocate Vishal Gupta appeared for the student.\n\nAdvocate Akshay Kumar Goel appeared for the Panjab University.\n\n**\\[Read Order\\]**\n\n,,"

Sibal said the platform functions on the principle of anonymity and it wants to be heard before such disclosure is ordered. \n\nHowever, the Court said the private defendants would have to come forward and defend themselves. \n\nSibal in response said there is a jurisprudence on the subject and threshold has to be met before passing of such order. \n\n\"_In these cases, there is reprisal ... all kinds of consequences_,\" he submitted.\n\nThe Court again asked how Wikipedia can defend such edits, which it _prima facia_ found to be defamatory. \n\n\"_The defence can be truth, you are not author. You cannot defend. You are only an intermediary_,\" Justice Gedela remarked. \n\nSibal explained the model of Wikipedia and said such edits are based on some source, which are news articles. He said that news organisation has not been made a party to the present case.\n\n\"_When the suit is filed, that publisher is not party and no injunction is sought_,\" he submitted. \n\nHowever, the Court observed that readership of Wikipedia is in millions as against the platform that has originally published the statement.\n\nLater during the hearing, Sibal suggested the private defendants can be served without disclosure of identity.\n\n\"_We would want some scrutiny this. The argument is it should not be automatic (disclosure). In other cases, there may be reprisal,_\" he added.\n\nSibal also questioned the urgency to order disclosure of information, pointing out that the edits on ANI's page date back to 2020 and 2021\\. \n\nAdvocate Sidhant Kumar, representing the ANI, defended the single judge's order and said that Wikipedia had not filed any pleading before that Court. \n\nKumar also submitted that Wikimedia was justifying the defamatory content by calling it fair comment. \n\n\"_There is agenda appellant has against us. There is a dedicated page on this case_,\" he told the Court. \n\nAt this stage, the Court slammed Wikipedia for the page and went on to question the advocate on record for \"not being able to restrain the client\". \n\n\"_You have put learned single-judge in line of fire. This page will have to be taken down, otherwise you will not hear . You may be backed by world's most powerful power but I think we live in a country which is governed by the rule of law and we take pride in tha_t,\" Justice Manmohan said.\n\nSibal said Wikipedia itself had not done it but he will seek instructions in this regard. He also agreed it should not be there. \n\n,"

Tushar then proceeded to escape by climbing out of the window onto an iron scaffolding behind the hotel, as he feared the knock was from a warden.\n\nThe scaffolding was installed by the hotel for cleaning and maintenance, but a portion of it was open and led to Tushar's fatal fall, reports say. His friends rushed him to AIIMS-Bhopal, where he was declared dead on arrival.\n\nThe sports festival was conducted on the weekend of October 10-13\\. The NLIU Student Body suspended the Valedictory Ceremony and instituted a formal code of conduct to observe two minutes of silence before every game to honour the student. "
